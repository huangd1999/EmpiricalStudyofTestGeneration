The first line of the input will have one integer $c$ ($0 \\leq c \\leq 45$). $c$ represents the number of edges in the formation. The next $c$ lines represent the connections between nodes represented as two integers $a$ ($0 \\leq a < 10$) and $b$ ($0 \\leq b < 10$), where $a$ is not equal to $b$. Then, the next $10$ lines will be the players on Johnny\u2019s team. Each line will contain four strings in the following order: player name, nation, league, team, which are delimited by a single space. These strings are guaranteed to be non-empty and consist of up to $15$ alphanumeric characters, which includes lower- and uppercase English letters, digits, and hyphens.\n\n-----Output-----\nIf a perfect team can be organized by Johnny, print yes.

People communicate using natural languages like English and Spanish, program with formal languages like C++ and Perl, and compose music with musical notation. Let\u2019s consider musical notation, which is typically a sequence of notes of specified pitches and durations. Computers can best represent these sequences using numbers and letters, such as\n\nC C D E C E D2 C C D E C2 B2 C C D E F E D C B g A B C2 C2\n\nwhich is a simple rendition of the song \u2018Yankee Doodle\u2019.

It would be nice to take this notation and create something musicians are more used to reading, with notes and bars and staffs, etc. Write a program that does this.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input for your program consists of two lines. The first line has an integer $1 \\le n \\le 100$ indicating the number of notes in the song. The second line contains $n$ notes. Each note consists of two parts: the pitch and the duration. The pitch is a letter a through g or A through G. Lowercase letters indicate the octave below uppercase letters, and we consider c to represent so-called \u2018middle c\u2019. The duration, which is optional, is a positive integer indicating a multiplier of the length of the default note.

People communicate using natural languages like English and Spanish, program with formal languages like C++ and Perl, and compose music with musical notation. Let\u2019s consider musical notation, which is typically a sequence of notes of specified pitches and durations. Computers can best represent these sequences using numbers and letters, such as\n\nC C D E C E D2 C C D E C2 B2 C C D E F E D C B g A B C2 C2\n\nwhich is a simple rendition of the song \u2018Yankee Doodle\u2019. The notes are chosen from a through g and A through G. A note without a number indicates it is held for a duration of one beat; the number $2$ following some of the notes indicate that note has a duration that is twice as long. It would be nice to take this notation and create something musicians are more used to reading, with notes and bars and staffs, etc. Write a program that does this.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input for your program consists of two lines. The first line has an integer $1 \\le n \\le 100$ indicating the number of notes in the song. The second line contains $n$ notes. Each note consists of two parts: the pitch and the duration. The pitch is a letter a through g or A through G. Lowercase letters indicate the octave below uppercase letters, and we consider c to represent so-called \u2018middle c\u2019. The duration, which is optional, is a positive integer indicating a multiplier of the length of the default note. (If you are musical you\u2019ll notice we\u2019ve made many simplifying assumptions, such as leaving out many octaves, sharps, flats, rests, time signatures, etc.)\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each song, print a text-based representation on one staff. Each staff should have the following format: a $5$-line staff (for the treble clef), middle c, and one more line (for the top of the bass clef):\n\nG:           \nF: ----------------------------------------------------------\nE:           \nD: ----------------------------------------------------------\nC:           \nB: ----------------------------------------------------------\nA:           \ng: ----------------------------------------------------------\nf:           \ne: ----------------------------------------------------------\nd:           \nc:           \nb:           \na: ----------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor each song\u2019s note, print a single asterisk on a line (or between lines) indicating its pitch. Use one asterisk for the default duration, two asterisks for notes twice as long, three asterisks for notes three times as long, etc. Leave a single separating column between each pair of consecutive notes. The staff lines should be only as long as necessary to complete the song.

Oira-Oira quickly found some $x$, which is the solution of the equation, but Cristobal Junta decided that Oira-Oira's result is not interesting enough, so he asked his colleague how many non-negative solutions of this equation exist.

These messages can each be represented by a permutation of size $n$. Let's call them $a$ and $b$.\n\nNote that a permutation of $n$ elements is a sequence of numbers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$, in which every number from $1$ to $n$ appears exactly once. \n\nThe message can be decoded by an arrangement of sequence $a$ and $b$, such that the number of matching pairs of elements between them is maximum. A pair of elements $a_i$ and $b_j$ is said to match if:   $i = j$, that is, they are at the same index.  $a_i = b_j$ \n\nHis two disciples are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times:   choose a number $k$ and cyclically shift one of the permutations to the left or right $k$ times. \n\nA single cyclic shift to the left on any permutation $c$ is an operation that sets $c_1:=c_2, c_2:=c_3, \\ldots, c_n:=c_1$ simultaneously. Likewise, a single cyclic shift to the right on any permutation $c$ is an operation that sets $c_1:=c_n, c_2:=c_1, \\ldots, c_n:=c_{n-1}$ simultaneously.\n\nHelp Ishika and Hriday find the maximum number of pairs of elements that match after performing the operation any (possibly zero) number of times.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5)$\u00a0\u2014 the size of the arrays.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ $(1 \\le a_i \\le n)$ \u2014 the elements of the first permutation.\n\nThe third line contains $n$ integers $b_1$, $b_2$, ..., $b_n$ $(1 \\le b_i \\le n)$ \u2014 the elements of the second permutation.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the maximum number of matching pairs of elements after performing the above operations some (possibly zero) times.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 3 4 5 1\n\nOutput\n5\nInput\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n4\n1 3 2 4\n4 2 3 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first case: $b$ can be shifted to the right by $k = 1$.

For all possible rotations of $a$ and $b$, the number of matching pairs won't exceed $1$.\n\nFor the third case: $b$ can be shifted to the left by $k = 1$. The resulting permutations will be $\\{1, 3, 2, 4\\}$ and $\\{2, 3, 1, 4\\}$. Positions $2$ and $4$ have matching pairs of elements.

        "prompt": "\n\ndef solution(grid, move):\n\n    \"\"\"2048 is a single-player puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli1. It is played on a $4 \\times 4$ grid that contains integers $\\geq 2$ that are powers of 2. The player can use a keyboard arrow key (left/up/right/down) to move all the tiles simultaneously. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Please observe this merging behavior carefully in all Sample Inputs and Outputs.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input is always a valid game state of a 2048 puzzle. The first four lines of input, that each contains four integers, describe the 16 integers in the $4 \\times 4$ grid of 2048 puzzle. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line denotes the content of the cell located at the $i$-th row and the $j$-th cell. For this problem, all integers in the input will be either {0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024}. Integer 0 means an empty cell.\n\nThe fifth line of input contains an integer 0, 1, 2, or 3 that denotes a left, up, right, or down move executed by the player, respectively.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput four lines with four integers each. Two integers in a line must be separated by a single space. This describes the new state of the $4 \\times 4$ grid of 2048 puzzle. Again, integer 0 means an empty cell. Note that in this problem, you can ignore the part from the 2048 puzzle where it introduces a new random tile with a value of either 2 or 4 in an empty spot of the board at the start of a new turn.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n2 0 0 2\n4 16 8 2\n2 64 32 4\n1024 1024 64 0\n0\nSample Output 1:\n4 0 0 0\n4 16 8 2\n2 64 32 4\n2048 64 0 0\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 0 0 2\n4 16 8 2\n2 64 32 4\n1024 1024 64 0\n1\nSample Output 2:\n2 16 8 4\n4 64 32 4\n2 1024 64 0\n1024 0 0 0\n\nSample Input 3:\n2 0 0 2\n4 16 8 2\n2 64 32 4\n1024 1024 64 0\n2\nSample Output 3:\n0 0 0 4\n4 16 8 2\n2 64 32 4\n0 0 2048 64\n\nSample Input 4:\n2 0 0 2\n4 16 8 2\n2 64 32 4\n1024 1024 64 0\n3\nSample Output 4:\n2 0 0 0\n4 16 8 0\n2 64 32 4\n1024 1024 64 4\n\nSample Input 5:\n2 2 4 8\n4 0 4 4\n16 16 16 16\n32 16 16 32\n0\nSample Output 5:\n4 4 8 0\n8 4 0 0\n32 32 0 0\n32 32 32 0\n\n    Examples:\n        assert solution([[2, 0, 0, 2], [4, 16, 8, 2], [2, 64, 32, 4], [1024, 1024, 64, 0]], 0) == [[4, 0, 0, 0], [4, 16, 8, 2], [2, 64, 32, 4], [2048, 64, 0, 0]]\n        assert solution([[2, 0, 0, 2], [4, 16, 8, 2], [2, 64, 32, 4], [1024, 1024, 64, 0]], 1) == [[2, 16, 8, 4], [4, 64, 32, 4], [2, 1024, 64, 0], [1024, 0, 0, 0]]\n        assert solution([[2, 0, 0, 2], [4, 16, 8, 2], [2, 64, 32, 4], [1024, 1024, 64, 0]], 2) == [[0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 16, 8, 2], [2, 64, 32, 4], [0, 0, 2048, 64]]\n    \"\"\"\n",

For that Inna has come up with an amusing game:  First Inna chooses a type of segments that she will use throughout the game. The segments can be either vertical or horizontal.  Then Inna makes multiple moves. In a single move, Inna can paint a segment of any length on the plane, she chooses its type at the beginning of the game (either vertical or horizontal), then all alarm clocks that are on this segment switch off. The game ends when all the alarm clocks are switched off. \n\nInna is very sleepy, so she wants to get through the alarm clocks as soon as possible. Help her, find the minimum number of moves in the game that she needs to turn off all the alarm clocks!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of the alarm clocks. The next n lines describe the clocks: the i-th line contains two integers x_{i}, y_{i} \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th alarm clock (0 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 100).\n\nNote that a single point in the room can contain any number of alarm clocks and the alarm clocks can lie on the sides of the square that represents the room.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of segments Inna will have to draw if she acts optimally.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n0 0\n0 1\n0 2\n1 0\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4\n0 0\n0 1\n1 0\n1 1\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4\n1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Inna first chooses type \"vertical segments\", and then she makes segments with ends at : (0, 0), (0, 2); and, for example, (1, 0), (1, 1). If she paints horizontal segments, she will need at least 3 segments.\n\nIn the third sample it is important to note that Inna doesn't have the right to change the type of the segments during the game. That's why she will need 3 horizontal or 3 vertical segments to end the game.\n\n    Examples:\n        assert solution(4, [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0)]) == 2\n        assert solution(4, [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]) == 2\n        assert solution(4, [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]) == 3\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef solution(n, positions):\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Unfortunately, $d_ B=v_ B-\\mathbf{V}=8-10=-2$, which means our largest box is not large enough.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose $\\mathbf{V}=980$, and we had four boxes, $W$, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ with dimensions $(10,10,10)$, $(10,5,2)$, $(5,3,2)$, and $(90,5,2)$, respectively. Their volumes will be $v_ W=1000$, $v_ X=100$, $v_ Y=30$ and $v_ Z=900$, making $W$ the largest box and, since $d_ W=v_ W-\\mathbf{V}=1000-980=20$, that means $W$ is big enough for all our items.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input specifies a set of boxes. It begins with a line containing two integers: $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$), specifying the number of boxes, and $\\mathbf{V}$, as defined above. The remaining input is composed of $n$ lines, each specifying one box. Each line contains the dimensions $l$, $w$, and $h$ for the box. You may assume that $1 \\leqslant l, w, h, \\mathbf{V} < 2^{32}$. You may also assume that, for any given box $i$, its volume $v_ i$ will always be less than\u00a0$2^{32}$\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output is a single integer: the value of $d_ i$ for the largest box by volume.\n\n-----Examples-----\nSample Input 1:\n3 10\n1 1 2\n2 2 2\n3 2 1\nSample Output 1:\n-2\n\nSample Input 2:\n3 30\n1 1 1\n5 2 3\n5 2 1\nSample Output 2:\n0\n\n    Examples:\n        assert solution(3, 10, [(1, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2), (3, 2, 1)]) == -2\n        assert solution(3, 30, [(1, 1, 1), (5, 2, 3), (5, 2, 1)]) == 0\n        assert solution(4, 980, [(10, 10, 10), (10, 5, 2), (5, 3, 2), (90, 5, 2)]) == 20\n    \"\"\"\n",

If Chef cannot get the desired apples, then output \"-1\" without quotes.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 2 \u2264 N \u2264 500000 (5 \u00d7 105)\n- 1 \u2264 K \u2264 1000000 (106)\n- 1 \u2264 Ti \u2264 1000000 (106)\n\n-----Example-----\nSample Input 1:\n5 5\n2 4 3 2 1\n\nSample Output 1:\n2\n\nSample Input 2:\n5 5\n2 4 9 2 5\n\nSample Output 2:\n-1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nIn the first example, if Chef leaves the first dog from left and gives it integer 4, and the second dog from right and gives it integer 1, then the first dog takes 2 seconds and the second dog takes 1 second to get the apples. Thus Chef needs to wait 2 seconds. In any other way, Chef can't get the desired apples in less than 2 seconds.\nIn the second example, Chef cannot get two apples such that the sum of their types is 5 so the answer is \"-1\".\n\n    Examples:\n        assert solution(5, 5, [2, 4, 3, 2, 1]) == 2\n        assert solution(5, 5, [2, 4, 9, 2, 5]) == -1\n        \n    \"\"\"\n",

She decided to organize a ceremony against the coronavirus.\n\nShe has $n$ friends who are also grannies (Maria is not included in this number). The $i$-th granny is ready to attend the ceremony, provided that at the time of her appearance in the courtyard there will be at least $a_i$ other grannies there. Note that grannies can come into the courtyard at the same time. Formally, the granny $i$ agrees to come if the number of other grannies who came earlier or at the same time with her is greater than or equal to $a_i$.\n\nGrannies gather in the courtyard like that.  Initially, only Maria is in the courtyard (that is, the initial number of grannies in the courtyard is $1$). All the remaining $n$ grannies are still sitting at home. On each step Maria selects a subset of grannies, none of whom have yet to enter the courtyard. She promises each of them that at the time of her appearance there will be at least $a_i$ other grannies (including Maria) in the courtyard. Maria can call several grannies at once. In this case, the selected grannies will go out into the courtyard at the same moment of time. She cannot deceive grannies, that is, the situation when the $i$-th granny in the moment of appearing in the courtyard, finds that now there are strictly less than $a_i$ other grannies (except herself, but including Maria), is prohibited. Please note that if several grannies appeared in the yard at the same time, then each of them sees others at the time of appearance. \n\nYour task is to find what maximum number of grannies (including herself) Maria can collect in the courtyard for the ceremony. After all, the more people in one place during quarantine, the more effective the ceremony!\n\nConsider an example: if $n=6$ and $a=[1,5,4,5,1,9]$, then:  at the first step Maria can call grannies with numbers $1$ and $5$, each of them will see two grannies at the moment of going out into the yard (note that $a_1=1 \\le 2$ and $a_5=1 \\le 2$);  at the second step, Maria can call grannies with numbers $2$, $3$ and $4$, each of them will see five grannies at the moment of going out into the yard (note that $a_2=5 \\le 5$, $a_3=4 \\le 5$ and $a_4=5 \\le 5$);  the $6$-th granny cannot be called into the yard \u00a0\u2014 therefore, the answer is $6$ (Maria herself and another $5$ grannies). \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input. Then test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of grannies (Maria is not included in this number).\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 2\\cdot10^5$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values $n$ over all test cases of the input does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n + 1$) \u2014 the maximum possible number of grannies in the courtyard.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5\n1 1 2 2 1\n6\n2 3 4 5 6 7\n6\n1 5 4 5 1 9\n5\n1 2 3 5 6\n\nOutput\n6\n1\n6\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case in the example, on the first step Maria can call all the grannies. Then each of them will see five grannies when they come out. Therefore, Maria and five other grannies will be in the yard.\n\nIn the second test case in the example, no one can be in the yard, so Maria will remain there alone.\n\nThe third test case in the example is described in the details above.\n\nIn the fourth test case in the example, on the first step Maria can call grannies with numbers $1$, $2$ and $3$. If on the second step Maria calls $4$ or $5$ (one of them), then when a granny appears in the yard, she will see only four grannies (but it is forbidden).

It\u2019s fancy: two wheels, with an auto-balancing system, several cameras, wireless connectivity, and a sattelite dish. There\u2019s just one little problem\u2026\n\nHe powered it up, sent it off for a test, and now it\u2019s not responding to any inputs. All he has is a photograph of the floor below it, acquired during an attempted rendition of Robot Ballet. Yraglac wasn\u2019t really paying attention to where it was, though, as he was too excited.\n\nThankfully, one of Yraglac\u2019s classmates has produced a huge stitched-together image of all of the floors in the University. Now all Yraglac has to do is figure out where this image of the floor is, and then he can just go and pick up the robot directly.\n\nUnfortunately, Yraglac doesn\u2019t have the patience to look through the entire huge image for anything that matches, so he wants to write a program that will find an initial set of locations that seem like candidates.\n\nThankfully, due to \u2026cough \u2026the fact that this is a competitive programming problem \u2026cough \u2026the images are of exactly the same scale, so Yraglac should be able to figure out where the robot is simply by checking how closely the robot\u2019s image matches the floor image at each possible place to overlay the robot\u2019s image on the floor image.\n\nYraglac will consider a location as a candidate if it is tied for having the most number of pixels the same between the two images.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe input consists of two images, the first of which is the last image seen from the robot, and the second is the entire floor of the university.\n\nEach image begins with a line consisting of two integers, $W$ and $H$, the width and height, respectively. You may assume that $W, H \\leq 1000$, and that the floor image is at least as large as the robot\u2019s image.\n\nFollowing on the next $H$ lines are $W$ space-separated integers, either 0 or 1, denoting the colour at the given pixel.\n\n-----Output-----\nThe output should consist of at least one line, one each for a candidate location, each containing a coordinate $(x,y)$ as two numbers separated by a single space, with $x$ first and $y$ second.

Given an integer, $n\\geqslant 1$, this conjecture pertains to the sequence $h(n)$, which we recursively define as follows:\n - If $n=1$, the sequence is composed of a single integer: $1$\n - If $n$ is even, the sequence is composed of $n$ followed by sequence $h(n/2)$\n - If $n$ is odd, the sequence is composed of $n$ followed by sequence $h(3\\cdot n + 1)$\n\nFor example, the following are the sequences for the numbers $5$ and $7$:\n\n$h(5) = (5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)$\n\n$h(7) = (7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)$\n\nThe $h(n)$ sequence is commonly known as the hailstone sequence, because of its nature of going up and down like a hailstone in a cloud before eventually falling to Earth.

It is meant to denote the set of integers that lie between the values a and b. For example [3,5] denotes the set {3,4,5} while the interval [3, 3] denotes the set {3}.\n\nWe say that an interval [a, b] is covered by an integer i, if i belongs to the set defined by [a, b]. For example interval [3, 5] is covered by 3 and so is the interval [3, 3].\n\nGiven a set of intervals I, and a set of integers S we say that I is covered by S if for each interval [a, b] in I there is an integer i in S such that [a, b] is covered by i.

Let's briefly look at the Gapja system, which is traditionally used in Korea to name the years.\n\nThere are two sequences of $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots, s_{n}$ and $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, t_3, \\ldots, t_{m}$.

There might be duplicates among these strings.\n\nLet's call a concatenation of strings $x$ and $y$ as the string that is obtained by writing down strings $x$ and $y$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the strings \"code\" and \"forces\" is the string \"codeforces\".\n\nThe year 1 has a name which is the concatenation of the two strings $s_1$ and $t_1$. When the year increases by one, we concatenate the next two strings in order from each of the respective sequences.

Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other (at any step of the process) and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stack.\n\nGiven an input array, figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single number n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10) \u2014 the size of the array.\n\nThe second line of input contains n space-separated integers a_{i} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the elements of the array.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput \"YES\" if the array can be sorted using the described procedure and \"NO\" if it can not.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\nYES\n\nInput\n3\n3 1 2\n\nOutput\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second example the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time: ravioli from stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2}.\n\n    Examples:\n        assert solution(3, [1, 2, 3]) == \"YES\"\n        assert solution(3, [3, 1, 2]) == \"NO\"\n        assert solution(1, [13]) == \"YES\"\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef solution(n, a):\n    return \"YES\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But he must count the number of pairs of positive integers $w$ and $h$, beforehand, such that $(w \\le a)$, $(h \\le b)$ and $(\\frac{w}{h} = \\frac{x}{y})$.\n\nIn other words, Monocarp wants to determine the number of TV sets having aspect ratio $\\frac{x}{y}$, screen width not exceeding $a$, and screen height not exceeding $b$. Two TV sets are considered different if they have different screen width or different screen height.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four integers $a$, $b$, $x$, $y$ ($1 \\le a, b, x, y \\le 10^{18}$)\u00a0\u2014 the constraints on the screen width and height, and on the aspect ratio.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of different variants to choose TV screen width and screen height so that they meet the aforementioned constraints.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n17 15 5 3\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n14 16 7 22\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n4 2 6 4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 999999866000004473 999999822000007597\n\nOutput\n1000000063\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, there are $3$ possible variants: $(5, 3)$, $(10, 6)$, $(15, 9)$.\n\nIn the second example, there is no TV set meeting the constraints.\n\nIn the third example, there is only one variant: $(3, 2)$.\n\n    Examples:\n        assert solution(17, 15, 5, 3) == 3\n        assert solution(14, 16, 7, 22) == 0\n        assert solution(4, 2, 6, 4) == 1\n    \"\"\"\n\ndef solution(a, b, x, y):\n    return 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And if he had an integer $n=6$, $n$ will be changed to $8$.\n\nOrac loved it so much, so he decided to repeat this operation several times.\n\nNow, for two positive integers $n$ and $k$, Orac asked you to add $f(n)$ to $n$ exactly $k$ times (note that $n$ will change after each operation, so $f(n)$ may change too) and tell him the final value of $n$.\n\nFor example, if Orac gives you $n=5$ and $k=2$, at first you should add $f(5)=5$ to $n=5$, so your new value of $n$ will be equal to $n=10$, after that, you should add $f(10)=2$ to $10$, so your new (and the final!) value of $n$ will be equal to $12$.\n\nOrac may ask you these queries many times.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input is a single integer $t\\ (1\\le t\\le 100)$: the number of times that Orac will ask you.\n\nEach of the next $t$ lines contains two positive integers $n,k\\ (2\\le n\\le 10^6, 1\\le k\\le 10^9)$, corresponding to a query by Orac.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ is at most $10^6$. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $t$ lines, the $i$-th of them should contain the final value of $n$ in the $i$-th query by Orac.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5 1\n8 2\n3 4\n\nOutput\n10\n12\n12\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first query, $n=5$ and $k=1$. The divisors of $5$ are $1$ and $5$, the smallest one except $1$ is $5$. Therefore, the only operation adds $f(5)=5$ to $5$, and the result is $10$.\n\nIn the second query, $n=8$ and $k=2$. The divisors of $8$ are $1,2,4,8$, where the smallest one except $1$ is $2$, then after one operation $8$ turns into $8+(f(8)=2)=10$.
